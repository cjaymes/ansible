# Rule Title: The system must use a separate file system for user home directories.
# Discussion: Ensuring that "/home" is mounted on its own partition enables the setting of more restrictive mount options, and also helps ensure that users cannot trivially fill partitions used for log or audit data storage.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Run the following command to determine if "/home" is on its own partition or logical volume:
#
# $ mount | grep "on /home "
#
# If "/home" has its own partition or volume group, a line will be returned.
# If no line is returned, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: If user home directories will be stored locally, create a separate partition for "/home" at installation time (or migrate it later using LVM). If "/home" will be mounted from another system such as an NFS server, then creating a separate partition is not necessary at installation time, and the mountpoint can instead be configured later.

# Discussion: The risk of a system's physical compromise, particularly mobile systems such as laptops, places its data at risk of compromise. Encrypting this data mitigates the risk of its loss if the system is lost.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Determine if encryption must be used to protect data on the system.
# If encryption must be used and is not employed, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 natively supports partition encryption through the Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to encrypt a partition is during installation time.
#
# For manual installations, select the "Encrypt" checkbox during partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually every time the system boots.
#
# For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding the "--encrypted" and "--passphrase=" options to the definition of each partition to be encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
#
# part / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=[PASSPHRASE]
#
# Any [PASSPHRASE] is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly. Omitting the "--passphrase=" option from the partition definition will cause the installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
#
# Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS can be found on the Red Hat Documentation web site:

# Check Content: Determine if encryption must be used to protect data on the system.
# If encryption must be used and is not employed, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 natively supports partition encryption through the Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to encrypt a partition is during installation time.
#
# For manual installations, select the "Encrypt" checkbox during partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually every time the system boots.
#
# For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding the "--encrypted" and "--passphrase=" options to the definition of each partition to be encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
#
# part / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=[PASSPHRASE]
#
# Any [PASSPHRASE] is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly. Omitting the "--passphrase=" option from the partition definition will cause the installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.

# Rule Title: The sticky bit must be set on all public directories.
# Discussion: Failing to set the sticky bit on public directories allows unauthorized users to delete files in the directory structure.
#
# The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories supplied with the system, or those designed to be temporary file repositories. The setting is normally reserved for directories used by the system, and by users for temporary file storage - such as /tmp - and for directories requiring global read/write access.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: To find world-writable directories that lack the sticky bit, run the following command for each local partition [PART]:
#
# # find [PART] -xdev -type d -perm -002 \! -perm -1000
#
#
# If any world-writable directories are missing the sticky bit, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: When the so-called 'sticky bit' is set on a directory, only the owner of a given file may remove that file from the directory. Without the sticky bit, any user with write access to a directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky bit prevents users from removing each other's files. In cases where there is no reason for a directory to be world-writable, a better solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application, consult that application's documentation instead of blindly changing modes.
# To set the sticky bit on a world-writable directory [DIR], run the following command:
#
# # chmod +t [DIR]

# Rule Title: All public directories must be owned by a system account.
# Discussion: Allowing a user account to own a world-writable directory is undesirable because it allows the owner of that directory to remove or replace any files that may be placed in the directory by other users.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: The following command will discover and print world-writable directories that are not owned by a system account, given the assumption that only system accounts have a uid lower than 500. Run it once for each local partition [PART]:
#
# # find [PART] -xdev -type d -perm -0002 -uid +499 -print
#
#
# If there is output, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: All directories in local partitions which are world-writable should be owned by root or another system account. If any world-writable directories are not owned by a system account, this should be investigated. Following this, the files should be deleted or assigned to an appropriate group.

# Rule Title: The noexec option must be added to the /tmp partition.
# Discussion: Allowing users to execute binaries from world-writable directories such as "/tmp" should never be necessary in normal operation and can expose the system to potential compromise.

# $ grep '\s/tmp' /etc/fstab
