# Rule Title: The system must provide automated support for account management functions.
# Discussion: A comprehensive account management process that includes automation helps to ensure the accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Enterprise environments make user account management challenging and complex. A user management process requiring administrators to manually address account management functions adds risk of potential oversight.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Interview the SA to determine if there is an automated system for managing user accounts, preferably integrated with an existing enterprise user management system.
#
# If there is not, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: Implement an automated system for managing user accounts that minimizes the risk of errors, either intentional or deliberate.  If possible, this system should integrate with an existing enterprise user management system, such as, one based Active Directory or Kerberos.

# Rule Title: The root account must be the only account having a UID of 0.
# Discussion: An account has root authority if it has a UID of 0. Multiple accounts with a UID of 0 afford more opportunity for potential intruders to guess a password for a privileged account. Proper configuration of sudo is recommended to afford multiple system administrators access to root privileges in an accountable manner.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: To list all password file entries for accounts with UID 0, run the following command:
#
# # awk -F: '($3 == 0) {print}' /etc/passwd
#
# This should print only one line, for the user root.
# If any account other than root has a UID of 0, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: If any account other than root has a UID of 0, this misconfiguration should be investigated and the accounts other than root should be removed or have their UID changed.

#
# "You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only. By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:
# -The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.
# -At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.
# -Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.

# -Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details."

# Rule Title: The system must be configured to require the use of a CAC, PIV compliant hardware token, or Alternate Logon Token (ALT) for authentication.
# Discussion: Smart card login provides two-factor authentication stronger than that provided by a username/password combination. Smart cards leverage a PKI (public key infrastructure) in order to provide and verify credentials.
# IA Controls:

#
# Standalone systems
# Application accounts
# Temporary employee accounts, such as students or interns, who cannot easily receive a CAC or PIV
# Operational tactical locations that are not collocated with RAPIDS workstations to issue CAC or ALT
# Test systems, such as those with an Interim Approval to Test (IATT) and use a separate VPN, firewall, or security measure preventing access to network and system components from outside the protection boundary documented in the IATT.

# Rule Title: Temporary accounts must be provisioned with an expiration date.
# Discussion: When temporary accounts are created, there is a risk they may remain in place and active after the need for them no longer exists. Account expiration greatly reduces the risk of accounts being misused or hijacked.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: For every temporary account, run the following command to obtain its account aging and expiration information:
#
# # chage -l [USER]
#
# Verify each of these accounts has an expiration date set as documented.
# If any temporary accounts have no expiration date set or do not expire within a documented time frame, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: In the event temporary accounts are required, configure the system to terminate them after a documented time period. For every temporary account, run the following command to set an expiration date on it, substituting "[USER]" and "[YYYY-MM-DD]" appropriately:
#
# # chage -E [YYYY-MM-DD] [USER]

# Rule Title: Accounts must be locked upon 35 days of inactivity.
# Discussion: Disabling inactive accounts ensures that accounts which may not have been responsibly removed are not available to attackers who may have compromised their credentials.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: To verify the "INACTIVE" setting, run the following command:
#
# grep "INACTIVE" /etc/default/useradd
#
# The output should indicate the "INACTIVE" configuration option is set to an appropriate integer as shown in the example below:
#
# # grep "INACTIVE" /etc/default/useradd
# INACTIVE=35
#
# If it does not, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: To specify the number of days after a password expires (which signifies inactivity) until an account is permanently disabled, add or correct the following lines in "/etc/default/useradd", substituting "[NUM_DAYS]" appropriately:
#
# INACTIVE=[NUM_DAYS]
#
# A value of 35 is recommended. If a password is currently on the verge of expiration, then 35 days remain until the account is automatically disabled. However, if the password will not expire for another 60 days, then 95 days could elapse until the account would be automatically disabled. See the "useradd" man page for more information. Determining the inactivity timeout must be done with careful consideration of the length of a "normal" period of inactivity for users in the particular environment. Setting the timeout too low incurs support costs and also has the potential to impact availability of the system to legitimate users.
