# The status of the "net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects" kernel parameter can be queried by running the following command:
#
# $ sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects
#
# The output of the command should indicate a value of "0". If this value is not the default value, investigate how it could have been adjusted at runtime, and verify it is not set improperly in "/etc/sysctl.conf".
#
# $ grep net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects /etc/sysctl.conf
#
# If the correct value is not returned, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: To set the runtime status of the "net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects" kernel parameter, run the following command:
#
# # sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects=0

# STIG ID: RHEL-06-000292
# Rule Title: The DHCP client must be disabled if not needed.
# Discussion: DHCP relies on trusting the local network. If the local network is not trusted, then it should not be used. However, the automatic configuration provided by DHCP is commonly used and the alternative, manual configuration, presents an unacceptable burden in many circumstances.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: If DHCP is required by the organization, this is Not Applicable.
#
# For each interface [IFACE] on the system (e.g. eth0), verify that DHCP is not being used:
#
# # cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-[IFACE] | grep -i “bootproto” | grep –v “#”
#
# BOOTPROTO=none
#
# If no output is returned this is a finding.
# If BOOTPROTO is not set to ”none”, this is a finding.
#
# Fix Text: For each interface [IFACE] on the system (e.g. eth0), edit "/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-[IFACE]" and make the following changes.
#
# Correct the BOOTPROTO line to read:
#
# BOOTPROTO=none
#

# Rule Title: The system must provide VPN connectivity for communications over untrusted networks.
# Discussion: Providing the ability for remote users or systems to initiate a secure VPN connection protects information when it is transmitted over a wide area network.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: If the system does not communicate over untrusted networks, this is not applicable.
#
# Run the following command to determine if the "libreswan" package is installed:
#

# Fix Text: The “libreswan” package provides an implementation of IPsec and IKE, which permits the creation of secure tunnels over untrusted networks. The "libreswan" package can be installed with the following command:
#
# # yum install libreswan
