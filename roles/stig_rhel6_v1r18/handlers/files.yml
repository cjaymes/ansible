# Rule Title: The Department of Defense (DoD) login banner must be displayed immediately prior to, or as part of, console login prompts.
# Discussion: An appropriate warning message reinforces policy awareness during the logon process and facilitates possible legal action against attackers.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: To check if the system login banner is compliant, run the following command:
#
# $ cat /etc/issue
#
#
# Note: The full text banner must be implemented unless there are character limitations that prevent the display of the full DoD logon banner.
#
# If the required DoD logon banner is not displayed, this is a finding.
#
# Fix Text: To configure the system login banner:
#
# Edit "/etc/issue". Replace the default text with a message compliant with the local site policy or a legal disclaimer. The DoD required text is either:
#
# "You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only. By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:
# -The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.
# -At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.
# -Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.
# -This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.
# -Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details."
#
# If the device cannot support the full DoD logon banner due to character limitations, the following text can be used:

# Rule Title: All rsyslog-generated log files must have mode 0600 or less permissive.

# Rule Title: There must be no world-writable files on the system.
# Discussion: Data in world-writable files can be modified by any user on the system. In almost all circumstances, files can be configured using a combination of user and group permissions to support whatever legitimate access is needed without the risk caused by world-writable files.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: To find world-writable files, run the following command for each local partition [PART], excluding special filesystems such as /selinux, /proc, or /sys:
#
# # find [PART] -xdev -type f -perm -002
#
# If there is output, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: It is generally a good idea to remove global (other) write access to a file when it is discovered. However, check with documentation for specific applications before making changes. Also, monitor for recurring world-writable files, as these may be symptoms of a misconfigured application or user account.
