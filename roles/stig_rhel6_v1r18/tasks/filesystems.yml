# Rule Title: The noexec option must be added to removable media partitions.
# Discussion: Allowing users to execute binaries from removable media such as USB keys exposes the system to potential compromise.

# Fix Text: The "noexec" mount option prevents the direct execution of binaries on the mounted filesystem. Users should not be allowed to execute binaries that exist on partitions mounted from removable media (such as a USB key). The "noexec" option prevents code from being executed directly from the media itself, and may therefore provide a line of defense against certain types of worms or malicious code. Add the "noexec" option to the fourth column of "/etc/fstab" for the line which controls mounting of any removable media partitions.

# Rule Title: The operating system must employ cryptographic mechanisms to protect information in storage.
# Discussion: The risk of a system's physical compromise, particularly mobile systems such as laptops, places its data at risk of compromise. Encrypting this data mitigates the risk of its loss if the system is lost.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Determine if encryption must be used to protect data on the system.
# If encryption must be used and is not employed, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 natively supports partition encryption through the Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to encrypt a partition is during installation time.
#
# For manual installations, select the "Encrypt" checkbox during partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually every time the system boots.
#
# For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding the "--encrypted" and "--passphrase=" options to the definition of each partition to be encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
#
# part / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=[PASSPHRASE]
#
# Any [PASSPHRASE] is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly. Omitting the "--passphrase=" option from the partition definition will cause the installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.

# Rule Title: The sticky bit must be set on all public directories.
# Discussion: Failing to set the sticky bit on public directories allows unauthorized users to delete files in the directory structure.
#
# The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories supplied with the system, or those designed to be temporary file repositories. The setting is normally reserved for directories used by the system, and by users for temporary file storage - such as /tmp - and for directories requiring global read/write access.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: To find world-writable directories that lack the sticky bit, run the following command for each local partition [PART]:
#
# # find [PART] -xdev -type d -perm -002 \! -perm -1000
#
#
# If any world-writable directories are missing the sticky bit, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: When the so-called 'sticky bit' is set on a directory, only the owner of a given file may remove that file from the directory. Without the sticky bit, any user with write access to a directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky bit prevents users from removing each other's files. In cases where there is no reason for a directory to be world-writable, a better solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application, consult that application's documentation instead of blindly changing modes.

# Severity: medium
# Group Title: SRG-OS-999999
# Rule ID: SV-71919r1_rule
# STIG ID: RHEL-06-000528
# Rule Title: The noexec option must be added to the /tmp partition.
# Discussion: Allowing users to execute binaries from world-writable directories such as "/tmp" should never be necessary in normal operation and can expose the system to potential compromise.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: To verify that binaries cannot be directly executed from the /tmp directory, run the following command:
#
# $ grep '\s/tmp' /etc/fstab
#
# The resulting output will show whether the /tmp partition has the "noexec" flag set. If the /tmp partition does not have the noexec flag set, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: The "noexec" mount option can be used to prevent binaries from being executed out of "/tmp". Add the "noexec" option to the fourth column of "/etc/fstab" for the line which controls mounting of "/tmp".
