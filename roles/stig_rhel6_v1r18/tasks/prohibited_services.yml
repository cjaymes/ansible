# Rule Title: Automated file system mounting tools must not be enabled unless needed.
# Discussion: All filesystems that are required for the successful operation of the system should be explicitly listed in "/etc/fstab" by an administrator. New filesystems should not be arbitrarily introduced via the automounter.
#
# The "autofs" daemon mounts and unmounts filesystems, such as user home directories shared via NFS, on demand. In addition, autofs can be used to handle removable media, and the default configuration provides the cdrom device as "/misc/cd". However, this method of providing access to removable media is not common, so autofs can almost always be disabled if NFS is not in use. Even if NFS is required, it is almost always possible to configure filesystem mounts statically by editing "/etc/fstab" rather than relying on the automounter.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: To verify the "autofs" service is disabled, run the following command:
#
# chkconfig --list autofs
#
# If properly configured, the output should be the following:
#
# autofs 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off
#
# Verify the "autofs" service is not running:
#
# # service autofs status
#
# If the autofs service is enabled or running, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: If the "autofs" service is not needed to dynamically mount NFS filesystems or removable media, disable the service for all runlevels:
#
# # chkconfig --level 0123456 autofs off
#
# Stop the service if it is already running:

# Rule Title: The Red Hat Network Service (rhnsd) service must not be running, unless using RHN or an RHN Satellite.
# Discussion: Although systems management and patching is extremely important to system security, management by a system outside the enterprise enclave is not desirable for some environments. However, if the system is being managed by RHN or RHN Satellite Server the "rhnsd" daemon can remain on.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: If the system uses RHN or an RHN Satellite, this is not applicable.
#
# To check that the "rhnsd" service is disabled in system boot configuration, run the following command:
#
# # chkconfig "rhnsd" --list
#
# Output should indicate the "rhnsd" service has either not been installed, or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:
#
# # chkconfig "rhnsd" --list
# "rhnsd" 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off
#
# Run the following command to verify "rhnsd" is disabled through current runtime configuration:
#
# # service rhnsd status
#
# If the service is disabled the command will return the following output:
#
# rhnsd is stopped
#
#
# If the service is running, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: The Red Hat Network service automatically queries Red Hat Network servers to determine whether there are any actions that should be executed, such as package updates. This only occurs if the system was registered to an RHN server or satellite and managed as such. The "rhnsd" service can be disabled with the following commands:

# Discussion: Mishandling crash data could expose sensitive information about vulnerabilities in software executing on the local machine, as well as sensitive information from within a process's address space or registers.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: To check that the "abrtd" service is disabled in system boot configuration, run the following command:
#
# # chkconfig "abrtd" --list
#
# Output should indicate the "abrtd" service has either not been installed, or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:

# # chkconfig "abrtd" --list
# "abrtd" 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off
#
# Run the following command to verify "abrtd" is disabled through current runtime configuration:

# If the service is running, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: The Automatic Bug Reporting Tool ("abrtd") daemon collects and reports crash data when an application crash is detected. Using a variety of plugins, abrtd can email crash reports to system administrators, log crash reports to files, or forward crash reports to a centralized issue tracking system such as RHTSupport.

# Rule Title: The atd service must be disabled.
# Discussion: The "atd" service could be used by an unsophisticated insider to carry out activities outside of a normal login session, which could complicate accountability. Furthermore, the need to schedule tasks with "at" or "batch" is not common.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: If the system requires the use of the "atd" service to support an organizational requirement, this is not applicable.
#
# To check that the "atd" service is disabled in system boot configuration, run the following command:
#
# # chkconfig "atd" --list
#
# Output should indicate the "atd" service has either not been installed, or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:

#
# If the service is disabled the command will return the following output:
#
# atd is stopped
#
#
# If the service is running, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: The "at" and "batch" commands can be used to schedule tasks that are meant to be executed only once. This allows delayed execution in a manner similar to cron, except that it is not recurring. The daemon "atd" keeps track of tasks scheduled via "at" and "batch", and executes them at the specified time. The "atd" service can be disabled with the following commands:

# Rule Title: The ntpdate service must not be running.
# Discussion: The "ntpdate" service may only be suitable for systems which are rebooted frequently enough that clock drift does not cause problems between reboots. In any event, the functionality of the ntpdate service is now available in the ntpd program and should be considered deprecated.

# Fix Text: The ntpdate service sets the local hardware clock by polling NTP servers when the system boots. It synchronizes to the NTP servers listed in "/etc/ntp/step-tickers" or "/etc/ntp.conf" and then sets the local hardware clock to the newly synchronized system time.

# Rule Title: The qpidd service must not be running.
# Discussion: The qpidd service is automatically installed when the "base" package selection is selected during installation. The qpidd service listens for network connections which increases the attack surface of the system. If the system is not intended to receive AMQP traffic then the "qpidd" service is not needed and should be disabled or removed.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: To check that the "qpidd" service is disabled in system boot configuration, run the following command:

# Rule Title: The rdisc service must not be running.
# Discussion: General-purpose systems typically have their network and routing information configured statically by a system administrator. Workstations or some special-purpose systems often use DHCP (instead of IRDP) to retrieve dynamic network configuration information.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: To check that the "rdisc" service is disabled in system boot configuration, run the following command:
