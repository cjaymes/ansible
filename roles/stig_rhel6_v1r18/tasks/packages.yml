# Rule Title: The system must allow locking of the console screen in text mode.
# Discussion: Installing "screen" ensures a console locking capability is available for users who may need to suspend console logins.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Run the following command to determine if the "screen" package is installed:
#
# # rpm -q screen
#
#
# If the package is not installed, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: To enable console screen locking when in text mode, install the "screen" package:
#
# # yum install screen
#
# Instruct users to begin new terminal sessions with the following command:
#
# $ screen
#
# The console can now be locked with the following key combination:
#
# ctrl+a x

# Rule Title: The openldap-servers package must not be installed unless required.
# Discussion: Unnecessary packages should not be installed to decrease the attack surface of the system.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: To verify the "openldap-servers" package is not installed, run the following command:
#
# $ rpm -q openldap-servers

#
# If it does not, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: The "openldap-servers" package should be removed if not in use.
#
# # yum erase openldap-servers
#
# The openldap-servers RPM is not installed by default on RHEL6 machines. It is needed only by the OpenLDAP server, not by the clients which use LDAP for authentication. If the system is not intended for use as an LDAP Server it should be removed.

# Discussion: The sendmail software was not developed with security in mind and its design prevents it from being effectively contained by SELinux. Postfix should be used instead.
