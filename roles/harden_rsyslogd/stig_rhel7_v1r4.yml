# Rule ID: SV-86675r1_rule
# STIG ID: RHEL-07-021100
# Rule Title: Cron logging must be implemented.
# Discussion: Cron logging can be used to trace the successful or unsuccessful execution of cron jobs. It can also be used to spot intrusions into the use of the cron facility by unauthorized and malicious users.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Verify that "rsyslog" is configured to log cron events.
#
# Check the configuration of "/etc/rsyslog.conf" for the cron facility with the following command:
#
# Note: If another logging package is used, substitute the utility configuration file for "/etc/rsyslog.conf".
#
# # grep cron /etc/rsyslog.conf
# cron.* /var/log/cron.log
#
# If the command does not return a response, check for cron logging all facilities by inspecting the "/etc/rsyslog.conf" file:
#
# # more /etc/rsyslog.conf
#
# Look for the following entry:
#
# *.* /var/log/messages
#
# If "rsyslog" is not logging messages for the cron facility or all facilities, this is a finding.
#
# If the entry is in the "/etc/rsyslog.conf" file but is after the entry "*.*", this is a finding.
# Fix Text: Configure "rsyslog" to log all cron messages by adding or updating the following line to "/etc/rsyslog.conf":
#
# cron.* /var/log/cron.log
#
# Note: The line must be added before the following entry if it exists in "/etc/rsyslog.conf":
#
# *.* ~ # discards everything

# Rule Title: The system must send rsyslog output to a log aggregation server.
# Discussion: Sending rsyslog output to another system ensures that the logs cannot be removed or modified in the event that the system is compromised or has a hardware failure.
# IA Controls:

# If there are no lines in the "/etc/rsyslog.conf" file that contain the "@" or "@@" symbol(s), and the lines with the correct symbol(s) to send output to another system do not cover all "rsyslog" output, ask the System Administrator to indicate how the audit logs are off-loaded to a different system or media.
#
# If there is no evidence that the audit logs are being sent to another system, this is a finding.

# Rule Title: The rsyslog daemon must not accept log messages from other servers unless the server is being used for log aggregation.
# Discussion: Unintentionally running a rsyslog server accepting remote messages puts the system at increased risk. Malicious rsyslog messages sent to the server could exploit vulnerabilities in the server software itself, could introduce misleading information in to the system's logs, or could fill the system's storage leading to a Denial of Service.
# If the system is intended to be a log aggregation server its use must be documented with the ISSO.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Verify that the system is not accepting "rsyslog" messages from other systems unless it is documented as a log aggregation server.
#
# Check the configuration of "rsyslog" with the following command:
#
# # grep imtcp /etc/rsyslog.conf
# ModLoad imtcp
#
# If the "imtcp" module is being loaded in the "/etc/rsyslog.conf" file, ask to see the documentation for the system being used for log aggregation.
#
# If the documentation does not exist, or does not specify the server as a log aggregation system, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: Modify the "/etc/rsyslog.conf" file to remove the "ModLoad imtcp" configuration line, or document the system as being used for log aggregation.
