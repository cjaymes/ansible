# STIG ID: RHEL-06-000133
# Rule Title: All rsyslog-generated log files must be owned by root.
# Discussion: The log files generated by rsyslog contain valuable information regarding system configuration, user authentication, and other such information. Log files should be protected from unauthorized access.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: The owner of all log files written by "rsyslog" should be root. These log files are determined by the second part of each Rule line in "/etc/rsyslog.conf" and typically all appear in "/var/log". To see the owner of a given log file, run the following command:
#
# $ ls -l [LOGFILE]
#
# Some log files referenced in /etc/rsyslog.conf may be created by other programs and may require exclusion from consideration.
#
# If the owner is not root, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: The owner of all log files written by "rsyslog" should be root. These log files are determined by the second part of each Rule line in "/etc/rsyslog.conf" typically all appear in "/var/log". For each log file [LOGFILE] referenced in "/etc/rsyslog.conf", run the following command to inspect the file's owner:
