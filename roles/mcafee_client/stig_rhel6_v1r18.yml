# Rule Title: The system must use and update a virus scan program.
# Discussion: Virus scanning software can be used to protect a system from penetration by computer viruses and to limit their spread through intermediate systems.
#
# The virus scanning software should be configured to perform scans dynamically on accessed files. If this capability is not available, the system must be configured to scan, at a minimum, all altered files on the system on a daily basis.
#
# If the system processes inbound SMTP mail, the virus scanner must be configured to scan all received mail.
#
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Check for the existence of a virus scan tool to be executed daily in the cron file:
#
# # crontab -l
#
# With the assistance of the system administrator, ensure the virus definition signature files are not older than seven (7) days.
#
# If a virus scanner is not being run daily or the virus definitions are older than seven (7) days, this is a finding.
#
# Fix Text: Install a virus scan tool.
#
# Ensure the virus signature definition files are no older than seven (7) days.
#
# Ensure the command line virus scan tool is run on a regular basis using a utility, such as cron.

# Rule ID: SV-50468r3_rule
# STIG ID: RHEL-06-000285
# Rule Title: The system must have a host-based intrusion detection tool installed.
# Discussion: Adding host-based intrusion detection tools can provide the capability to automatically take actions in response to malicious behavior, which can provide additional agility in reacting to network threats. These tools also often include a reporting capability to provide network awareness of system, which may not otherwise exist in an organization's systems management regime.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Ask the SA or ISSO if a host-based intrusion detection application is loaded on the system. Per OPORD 16-0080 the preferred intrusion detection system is McAfee HBSS available through Cybercom.
#
# If another host-based intrusion detection application is in use, such as SELinux, this must be documented and approved by the local Authorizing Official.
#
# Procedure:
# Examine the system to see if the Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) is installed:
#
# # rpm -qa | grep MFEhiplsm
#
# Verify that the McAfee HIPS module is active on the system:
#
# # ps -ef | grep -i “hipclient”
#
# If the MFEhiplsm package is not installed, check for another intrusion detection system:
#
# # find / -name <daemon name>
#
# Where <daemon name> is the name of the primary application daemon to determine if the application is loaded on the system.
#
# Determine if the application is active on the system:
#
# # ps -ef | grep -i <daemon name>
#
# If the MFEhiplsm package is not installed and an alternate host-based intrusion detection application has not been documented for use, this is a finding.
#
# If no host-based intrusion detection system is installed and running on the system, this is a finding.
#
# Fix Text: Install and enable the latest McAfee HIPS package, available from Cybercom.
#
# If the system does not support the McAfee HIPS package, install and enable a supported intrusion detection system application and document its use with the Authorizing Official.
