# Rule Title: A FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic algorithm must be used for SSH communications.
# Discussion: Unapproved mechanisms that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module are not verified and therefore cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and DoD data may be compromised.
#
# Operating systems utilizing encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant mechanisms for authenticating to cryptographic modules.
#
# FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to access cryptographic modules utilize authentication that meets DoD requirements. This allows for Security Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on a general purpose computing system.

# Rule Title: The Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner must be displayed immediately prior to, or as part of, remote access logon prompts.
# Discussion: Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting access to the publicly accessible operating system ensures privacy and security notification verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
#
# System use notifications are required only for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.
#
# The banner must be formatted in accordance with applicable DoD policy. Use the following verbiage for operating systems that can accommodate banners of 1300 characters:
#
# "You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.
#
# By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:
#

#
# -At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.
#
# -Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.
#
# -This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.
#
# -Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants.

An example configuration line is:
#
# banner /etc/issue
#
# Either create the file containing the banner or replace the text in the file with the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner. The DoD required text is:

# Rule Title: All network connections associated with SSH traffic must terminate at the end of the session or after 10 minutes of inactivity, except to fulfill documented and validated mission requirements.
# Discussion: Terminating an idle SSH session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.
#
# Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session.

# Rule Title: The SSH daemon must not permit Kerberos authentication unless needed.
# Discussion: Kerberos authentication for SSH is often implemented using Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSSAPI). If Kerberos is enabled through SSH, the SSH daemon provides a means of access to the system's Kerberos implementation. Vulnerabilities in the system's Kerberos implementation may then be subject to exploitation. To reduce the attack surface of the system, the Kerberos authentication mechanism within SSH must be disabled for systems not using this capability.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Verify the SSH daemon does not permit Kerberos to authenticate passwords unless approved.
#
# Check that the SSH daemon does not permit Kerberos to authenticate passwords with the following command:
#
# # grep -i kerberosauth /etc/ssh/sshd_config
