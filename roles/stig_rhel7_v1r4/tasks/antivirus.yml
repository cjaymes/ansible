# Rule ID: SV-86837r2_rule
# STIG ID: RHEL-07-032000
# Rule Title: The system must use a virus scan program.
# Discussion: Virus scanning software can be used to protect a system from penetration from computer viruses and to limit their spread through intermediate systems.
#
# The virus scanning software should be configured to perform scans dynamically on accessed files. If this capability is not available, the system must be configured to scan, at a minimum, all altered files on the system on a daily basis.
#
# If the system processes inbound SMTP mail, the virus scanner must be configured to scan all received mail.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Verify the system is using a virus scan program.
#
# Check for the presence of "McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux" with the following command:
#
# # systemctl status nails
# nails - service for McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux
# >  Loaded: loaded /opt/NAI/package/McAfeeVSEForLinux/McAfeeVSEForLinux-2.0.2.<build_number>; enabled)
# >  Active: active (running) since Mon 2015-09-27 04:11:22 UTC;21 min ago
#
# If the "nails" service is not active, check for the presence of "clamav" on the system with the following command:
#
# # systemctl status clamav-daemon.socket
#  systemctl status clamav-daemon.socket
#   clamav-daemon.socket - Socket for Clam AntiVirus userspace daemon
#      Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/clamav-daemon.socket; enabled)
#      Active: active (running) since Mon 2015-01-12 09:32:59 UTC; 7min ago
#
# If neither of these applications are loaded and active, ask the System Administrator if there is an antivirus package installed and active on the system.
#
# If no antivirus scan program is active on the system, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: Install an antivirus solution on the system.

# Rule ID: SV-86839r2_rule
# STIG ID: RHEL-07-032010
# Rule Title: The system must update the virus scan program every seven days or more frequently.
# Discussion: Virus scanning software can be used to protect a system from penetration from computer viruses and to limit their spread through intermediate systems.
#
# The virus scanning software should be configured to check for software and virus definition updates with a frequency no longer than seven days. If a manual process is required to update the virus scan software or definitions, it must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO).
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Verify the system is using a virus scan program and the virus definition file is less than seven days old.
#
# Check for the presence of "McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux" with the following command:

#
# If "McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux" is active on the system, check the dates of the virus definition files with the following command:
#
# # ls -al /opt/NAI/LinuxShield/engine/dat/*.dat
# <need output>
#
# If the virus definition files have dates older than seven days from the current date, this is a finding.
#
# If "clamav" is active on the system, check the dates of the virus database with the following commands:
#
# # grep -I databasedirectory /etc/clamav.conf
# DatabaseDirectory /var/lib/clamav
#
# # ls -al /var/lib/clamav/*.cvd
# -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root      149156 Mar  5  2011 daily.cvd
#
# If the database file has a date older than seven days from the current date, this is a finding.
