# Rule Title: The Network File System (NFS) must be configured to use RPCSEC_GSS.
# Discussion: When an NFS server is configured to use RPCSEC_SYS, a selected userid and groupid are used to handle requests from the remote user.

# # cat /etc/fstab | grep nfs
# 192.168.21.5:/mnt/export /data1 nfs4 rw,sync ,soft,sec=krb5:krb5i:krb5p
