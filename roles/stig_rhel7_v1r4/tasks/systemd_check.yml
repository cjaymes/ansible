# Vuln ID: V-71993
# Severity: high
# Group Title: SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227
# Rule ID: SV-86617r1_rule
# STIG ID: RHEL-07-020230
# Rule Title: The x86 Ctrl-Alt-Delete key sequence must be disabled.
# Discussion: A locally logged-on user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete, when at the console, can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In the GNOME graphical environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Verify the operating system is not configured to reboot the system when Ctrl-Alt-Delete is pressed.
#
# Check that the ctrl-alt-del.service is not active with the following command:
#
# # systemctl status ctrl-alt-del.service
# reboot.target - Reboot
#    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/reboot.target; disabled)
#    Active: inactive (dead)
#      Docs: man:systemd.special(7)
#
# If the ctrl-alt-del.service is active, this is a finding.
# Fix Text: Configure the system to disable the Ctrl-Alt_Delete sequence for the command line with the following command:
#
# # systemctl mask ctrl-alt-del.target
#
# If GNOME is active on the system, create a database to contain the system-wide setting (if it does not already exist) with the following command:
#
# # cat /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-disable-CAD
#
# Add the setting to disable the Ctrl-Alt_Delete sequence for GNOME:
#
# [org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys]
# logout=’’

# Rule Title: The operating system must require authentication upon booting into single-user and maintenance modes.
# Discussion: If the system does not require valid root authentication before it boots into single-user or maintenance mode, anyone who invokes single-user or maintenance mode is granted privileged access to all files on the system.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Verify the operating system must require authentication upon booting into single-user and maintenance modes.
#
# Check that the operating system requires authentication upon booting into single-user mode with the following command:
#
# # grep -i execstart /usr/lib/systemd/system/rescue.service
#
# ExecStart=-/bin/sh -c "/usr/sbin/sulogin; /usr/bin/systemctl --fail --no-block default"
#
# If "ExecStart" does not have "/usr/sbin/sulogin" as an option, this is a finding.
#
# Fix Text: Configure the operating system to require authentication upon booting into single-user and maintenance modes.
#
# Add or modify the "ExecStart" line in "/usr/lib/systemd/system/rescue.service" to include "/usr/sbin/sulogin":
