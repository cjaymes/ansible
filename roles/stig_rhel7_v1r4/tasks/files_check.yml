# Rule Title: All local interactive user initialization files executable search paths must contain only paths that resolve to the users home directory.
# Discussion: The executable search path (typically the PATH environment variable) contains a list of directories for the shell to search to find executables. If this path includes the current working directory (other than the user’s home directory), executables in these directories may be executed instead of system commands. This variable is formatted as a colon-separated list of directories. If there is an empty entry, such as a leading or trailing colon or two consecutive colons, this is interpreted as the current working directory. If deviations from the default system search path for the local interactive user are required, they must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO).
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Verify that all local interactive user initialization files' executable search path statements do not contain statements that will reference a working directory other than the users’ home directory.
#
# Check the executable search path statement for all local interactive user initialization files in the users' home directory with the following commands:

# Fix Text: Edit the local interactive user initialization files to change any PATH variable statements that reference directories other than their home directory.
#
# If a local interactive user requires path variables to reference a directory owned by the application, it must be documented with the ISSO.

# Rule Title: Local initialization files must not execute world-writable programs.
# Discussion: If user start-up files execute world-writable programs, especially in unprotected directories, they could be maliciously modified to destroy user files or otherwise compromise the system at the user level. If the system is compromised at the user level, it is easier to elevate privileges to eventually compromise the system at the root and network level.

#
# Note: The example will be for a system that is configured to create users’ home directories in the "/home" directory.

# Discussion: If an unauthorized or modified device is allowed to exist on the system, there is the possibility the system may perform unintended or unauthorized operations.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Verify that all system device files are correctly labeled to prevent unauthorized modification.
#
# List all device files on the system that are incorrectly labeled with the following commands:
#
# Note: Device files are normally found under "/dev", but applications may place device files in other directories and may necessitate a search of the entire system.

# #find /dev -context *:device_t:* \( -type c -o -type b \) -printf "%p %Z\n"
#
# #find /dev -context *:unlabeled_t:* \( -type c -o -type b \) -printf "%p %Z\n"
#
# Note: There are device files, such as "/dev/vmci", that are used when the operating system is a host virtual machine. They will not be owned by a user on the system and require the "device_t" label to operate. These device files are not a finding.
#
# If there is output from either of these commands, other than already noted, this is a finding.

#
# # rpm -qf <filename>

# Rule Title: All world-writable directories must be group-owned by root, sys, bin, or an application group.
# Discussion: If a world-writable directory has the sticky bit set and is not group-owned by a privileged Group Identifier (GID), unauthorized users may be able to modify files created by others.
#
# The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories supplied with the system or those designed to be temporary file repositories.
