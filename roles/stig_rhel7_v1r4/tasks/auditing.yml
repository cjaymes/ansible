# Rule Title: Auditing must be configured to produce records containing information to establish what type of events occurred, where the events occurred, the source of the events, and the outcome of the events.

# These audit records must also identify individual identities of group account users.
# Discussion: Without establishing what type of events occurred, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.

# Rule Title: The operating system must shut down upon audit processing failure, unless availability is an overriding concern. If availability is a concern, the system must alert the designated staff (System Administrator [SA] and Information System Security Officer [ISSO] at a minimum) in the event of an audit processing failure.
# Discussion: It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without this notification, the security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, and system operation may be adversely affected.
#
# Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.
#
# This requirement applies to each audit data storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit records are stored), the centralized audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories combined), or both.

#
# Check to see what level "auditctl" is set to with following command:
#
# # auditctl -s | grep -i "fail"

#
# If the value of "failure" is set to "2", the system is configured to panic (shut down) in the event of an auditing failure.
#
# If the value of "failure" is set to "1", the system is configured to only send information to the kernel log regarding the failure.
#
# If the "failure" setting is not set, this is a CAT I finding.
#
# If the "failure" setting is set to any value other than "1" or "2", this is a CAT II finding.
#
# If the "failure" setting is set to "1" but the availability concern is not documented or there is no monitoring of the kernel log, this is a CAT III finding.
#
# Fix Text: Configure the operating system to shut down in the event of an audit processing failure.

# # auditctl -f 2
#
# Edit the "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" file and add the following line:

#

# Edit the "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" file and add the following line:

# Rule Title: All privileged function executions must be audited.
# Discussion: Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat.
# IA Controls:
# Check Content: Verify the operating system audits the execution of privileged functions.
#

#
# # find [PART] -xdev -type f \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) 2>/dev/null
#
# Run the following command to verify entries in the audit rules for all programs found with the previous command:
#
# # grep -i "<suid_prog_with_full_path>" /etc/audit/audit.rules
# -a always,exit -F path="<suid_prog_with_full_path>" -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k setuid/setgid
#
# All "setuid" and "setgid" files on the system must have a corresponding audit rule, or must have an audit rule for the (sub) directory that contains the "setuid"/"setgid" file.
